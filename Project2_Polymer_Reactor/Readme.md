# Melt Flow Rate Prediction from Polymer Production Dataset

This study aims to analyze polymer production data to predict the melt-flow rate by using several ML regression techniques.

It utilizes the "polymer reactor" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apek1999/predict-mpv-of-polymer)
